# My portfolio built using Bootstrap v4.6

## My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This project is a showcase of my frontend development skills, including my design process and completed projects

## Design Phase

I used google slides to create a wireframe of the project. I started by sketching out different sections of the page including Nav section, jumpotron and the work section.

I then created a color scheme and typography style to match my personal brand and give the portfolio a cohesive look. 

I used Bootsrap v4.6 as the foundation for the design of my portfolio, I used Bootstrap's grid system and components. I customised the style further using css and css variables as needed. 
lastly i added some interactive elements such as a typing animation the first time you load the page and also a hoover effect that makes projects card look bigger when you hoover on it. 

## project cards

the project cards shown below showcase my completed projects, including a brief description of the technology used to build the project and a button that link to view the project live. I have included projects that demonstrated my skills in HTML, CSS and responsive design
